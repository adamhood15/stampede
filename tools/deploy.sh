# never edits the repo's index.html itself, only a generated copy under
# waterpark-leaderboard/game/ (gitignored, rebuilt every run):
#   - "assets/...                        -> "/wp-content/plugins/waterpark-leaderboard/game-assets/...
#   - REPLACE-WITH-RAILWAY-URL placeholder -> the real deployed Railway service URL
# The repo's own index.html keeps working unmodified against
# `python3 server.py` for local dev.
#
# STAMPEDE_LEADERBOARD_API must be set to the deployed leaderboard-service
# URL (e.g. https://stampede-leaderboard-production.up.railway.app) —
# Railway assigns/manages this, so it can't be hardcoded here the way the
# old Kinsta dev URL was.
#
# No --delete on the rsync of the plugin folder itself — this only ever adds
# forward; run a manual cleanup if a file needs to go away.
